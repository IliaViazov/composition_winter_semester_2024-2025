Unfortunately, in current situation many of us, who was working in Finale to engrave their scores, are forced to switch to another score editing software due to the reason that Finale won't be supported anymore, so it means that we have the last current version of it and only one year of possibility to install it on another device and authorize with our license. Of course, we still can use our installed instances of the programm until its compability reaches the border of new OS architecture, but it's not forever. 

During the past decades, we saw rise and dawn of Sibelius from incredible alternative to Finale to subscription-based software (which price is extremelly unplesant, especially for students), and painful death of Finale. Now we do have another corporate monster â€” Dorico. I'm very afraid that no matter how good and developed Dorico now is, it could happen with it the same.

That's why I want to introduce you Lilypond, a free open-source cross-platform software for engraving scores. 20 years ago Lilypond was mostly like a joke on the background of such giants like Sibelius and Finale, but during these years it was developing by hands of enthusiast and now is a very good alternative to existing software.
Lilypond is written on one of the dialects of Lisp, which makes it super compatible and reusable on all devices. Even without its original team project will continue develop because of its architecture and open-source.



I wouldn't laugh because I know the problem with compatibility of software on MacOS. Especially, you can find it in some libraries of machine learning for Max. I have a few very important Max libraries that are not compatible with arm chip and I use it through Rosetta, if I need.
Actually, learning Lilypond in your case maybe more important in perspective as you think. You work with open music a lot, and it's also a lisp based environment, and there is a lot of opportunities just to make ready to go scores for LP out of OM. I'm silent about BACH, they made this feature even better.
I sound like manifesto, but I believe that Lilypond is the future just because of its architecture that can be renovated at any time for any machine and open-source. So you any time can expect that someone will take it under the wing to develop. And of course too many composers use it, especially almost all of who works with CAO.
